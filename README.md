# Object_detection
Object detection using YOLOv3 model


The input and output image paths are mentioned in the python file yolo.py.
The yolov3 weight file is being removed due to its size constraints.
After adding the weight file(can be downloaded from any trusted source) in the path yolo-coco, execute the following command to run the model:

$python3 yolo.py --yolo yolo-coco
